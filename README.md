# Pompeii
Pompeii is a classically set, city defense side scroller. Placed in the ancient city of Pompeii at the moment of its destruction, you are the last remaining defense of this great civilization. Armed with only a spear and an iron will, on which the city was built, it is your duty to destroy the impending doom before it engulfs the city entirely!  

## background
Pompeii was an ancient city that was settled below the large volcano Mount Vesuvius that exploded and instantly destroyed the city. The people of Pompeii were frozen in time by the ash of Vesuvius, encapsulating the moment of their deaths, some praying, some running, some holding their dear ones close. The tragic story of Pompeii is not only a foreboding warning about the might and unpredictability of the mighty Vesuvius, but also a tale of the lives that will forever be immortalized in stone and ash.
